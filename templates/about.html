        This system is designed to control relays for managing a drink machine. Each relay corresponds to a pump, 
        allowing users to program the pumps to operate for specific durations, making it easy to customise drink preparation.

        There was a lot of coffee consumed in the making of this... Yes.... Coffee... I know I know it should have been beer... 
        But coffee was what was consumed. Anyway! The result of all the coffee is that there may be bugs here. If you find one of those pesky annoyances, 
        please let me know, and I will take care of it... For good...
